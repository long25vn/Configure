## Scheduling containers

### Automatic scheduling


Some configuration options result in containers being automatically scheduled on the same Swarm node to ensure that they work correctly. These are:

  + network_mode: "service:..." and network_mode: "container:..." (and net: "container:..." in the version 1 file format).

  + volumes_from

  + links

## Manual scheduling

Swarm offers a rich set of scheduling and affinity hints, enabling you to control where containers are located. They are specified via container environment variables, so you can use Composeâ€™s environment option to set them.

```
# Schedule containers on a specific node
environment:
  - "constraint:node==node-1"

# Schedule containers on a node that has the 'storage' label set to 'ssd'
environment:
  - "constraint:storage==ssd"

# Schedule containers where the 'redis' image is already pulled
environment:
  - "affinity:image==redis"

```
